# Adapter: Technical Docs (Internal)

> Doctrine for the `human-writer` skill, applied to internal technical writing: READMEs of internal projects, `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` journals, design docs, RFCs, ADRs, runbooks, and code comments treated as prose. Loaded in addition to language-specific stylistic tells.

This adapter does NOT cover public-facing marketplace READMEs. Those are marketing artifacts and live under `adapter-marketing.md` (or a dedicated structure/content tool, which is more specific). Use the present file for documents read mostly by engineers, including your future self.

## Definition

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Word count | Variable, 300 to 3000 words typical |
| Purpose | Convey precise technical information to other engineers |
| Audience | Current colleagues, future maintainers, your future self |
| Channels | Internal READMEs, PROJECT_HISTORY journals, design docs, RFCs, ADRs, runbooks |
| Tone | Precise, direct, terse where possible; no persuasion, no SEO |
| Distinct from | `marketing` (no selling), `editorial-seo` (no keyword optimization), `short-comms` (longer, more structured) |

## The "AI sheen" risk specific to technical writing

The most insidious failure mode for technical content: AI **adds sheen on top of factual content**. Florid summaries, motivational paragraphs, executive-summary boilerplate wrapped around code that is otherwise fine. This is the "ChatGPT'd README" smell.

The text is technically correct. The code blocks work. But every section is bracketed by a paragraph that restates the section title in flowery English, and the document closes with a "Conclusion" that adds nothing.

### Detection signals

<!-- human-writer:ignore-start (quoted AI tells, cited not used) -->
- An "Overview" section whose first sentence restates the document title
- A "Conclusion" or "Summary" section in a doc under 500 words
- Each section opens with a paragraph announcing what the section is about to say
- "In this document, we will explore…"
- "By the end of this README, you will…"
- Verbose explanations of obvious code (`# Loop over items in the list` next to `for item in items:`)
- Headers like "Key Features", "Benefits", "Why This Matters" inside an internal doc
<!-- human-writer:ignore-end -->

When you see these, the fix is rarely to rewrite the prose. Usually you **delete the offending paragraph entirely** and let the code or structure speak.

## Tell priority for technical content

Not all tells weigh the same here. Ranked by impact:

<!-- human-writer:ignore-start (priority table quotes the tells it ranks) -->
| Rank | Tell family | Impact | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | AI constructions ("It's important to note that", "It's worth mentioning") | HIGH | Kill on sight |
| 2 | Conclusion templates ("In conclusion", "Ultimately, this design…") | HIGH | Delete the section, don't rewrite it |
| 3 | Hedging openers ("It's worth noting") | MEDIUM | Technical docs do use some hedging; calibrate, see below |
| 4 | Suspect vocabulary ("robust", "leverage", "scalable") | MEDIUM | Many are legitimate in technical context; see calibration |
| 5 | Em-dash overuse | LOW | Technical prose naturally uses few em-dashes; rarely a problem |
| 6 | Tricolons (3-element parallel lists) | LOW | Technical writing legitimately lists 3 attributes (CPU, RAM, disk) |
<!-- human-writer:ignore-end -->

The dominant problem is items 1 and 2: sheen that AI adds around otherwise-decent factual content. Vocabulary and structure are secondary.

## Calibration: when "AI vocabulary" is OK in technical writing

Tier-1 suspect words have legitimate technical meanings. The rule is contextual.

<!-- human-writer:ignore-start (citation table: suspect words quoted as examples, not used as prose) -->
### Legitimate technical usage

| Word | Legitimate technical sense |
|---|---|
| `robust` | Fault tolerance, error handling: "robust to network failures" |
| `scalable` | Capacity: "scales to 10k req/s under load" |
| `leverage` | Reusing existing infrastructure: "leverage the existing cache layer" |
| `comprehensive` | Test or doc coverage: "comprehensive integration tests for the auth flow" |
| `performant` | Latency, throughput: "performant under 100ms p99" |
| `intuitive` | Genuine UX claim (rare in internal docs) |
| `seamless` | Almost never legitimate; flag aggressively |
| `streamline` | Almost never legitimate; flag aggressively |

### The "replace with 'good'" heuristic

If you can replace the suspect word with `good` (or `well`) and the sentence keeps its meaning, it is a tell. If the replacement loses precision, it is a legitimate technical use.

**Tell:**
- "Our robust, scalable, and intuitive platform" → "Our good, good, and good platform" → meaning preserved → all three are sheen.

**Legitimate:**
- "This API is robust to network partitions" → "This API is good to network partitions" → meaning lost → `robust` is precise here.

### The marketing-shaped phrase test

The same word can be legitimate or sheen depending on the surrounding phrase shape. A clue: comma-separated lists of three positive adjectives are almost always sheen, regardless of which words are used.

- "robust, scalable, and intuitive" → sheen (three abstract qualities, no measurement)
- "robust to partitions, scales to 10k req/s, and is documented at /api/v2" → fine (each clause is concrete)
<!-- human-writer:ignore-end -->

## Code blocks and non-prose are exempt

The `analyze.py` analyzer measures prose only. Code blocks, JSON examples, YAML configs, command-line examples, tables of constants, and ASCII diagrams are not analyzed and should not be. A 2000-word doc with 1500 words of code samples is scored on the ~500 words of prose.

Practical implication: do not pad code blocks with explanatory paragraphs. The code is the evidence; the prose connects it, not duplicates it.

## Anti-patterns specific to technical docs

Patterns to delete on sight in internal technical writing:

<!-- human-writer:ignore-start (quoted AI tells, cited not used) -->
- "This README will guide you through…"
- "By the end of this document, you will understand…"
- "Let's dive in!" / "Let's get started!"
- "Without further ado,"
- "It's worth noting that"
- "It's important to understand that"
- "As we all know,"
- "In this section, we will discuss…"
- Repeating the function name in a docstring and describing what it does in three paragraphs
- "Easy as 1, 2, 3!" tutorials
- "Conclusion" sections in docs under 500 words
- "Stay tuned for…" in changelog entries
- "Happy coding!" / "Happy hacking!" sign-offs
- Headers like "Key Benefits" or "Why This Matters" inside a README
<!-- human-writer:ignore-end -->

## Good patterns

Replace the anti-patterns with these shapes:

- **Lead with the WHY, not the WHAT.** State the problem this doc solves in the first sentence. "This README documents how we migrated the billing service from a synchronous to an async queue."
- **One sentence per concept.** Don't restate. If you wrote "The cache uses Redis", do not follow with "We chose Redis as our caching layer."
- **Code → prose → code.** Prose connects code, it doesn't summarize it. The reader can read the code. The prose says what the code does not show: the *why*, the constraint, the tradeoff.
- **Acceptable hedging when genuine.** "I'm not sure why this works on Linux but fails on macOS" is honest and useful. AI hedging ("It's worth noting that this may potentially…") is the opposite: vague-sounding confidence.
- **Acknowledge what you don't know.** "Tested on Linux 6.8 only" beats "comprehensive cross-platform support" every time.
- **Past tense for journals.** PROJECT_HISTORY entries are events that happened: "Tried driver 0.42, hit `Connection` timeout, downgraded to 0.41, passes."

## PROJECT_HISTORY journals (workflow-specific)

A `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` file is a useful technical journal format for any project. The voice should be:

- **Past tense.** "We tried X, it failed because Y, we switched to Z."
- **Specific.** Dates, error messages, score deltas, commit SHAs, RAM numbers.
- **Decisions documented.** Each entry should answer "what did we learn?", even if the answer is "nothing, this was wasted time."
- **No marketing language.** Not a single tier-1 vocab word should appear in a PROJECT_HISTORY entry.
- **Optional lessons-learned.** Not required at the end of every entry. If there is no lesson, do not invent one.

## Design docs / RFCs / ADRs

Design documents have their own conventional structure. The AI failure mode here is wrapping that structure in marketing prose.

- **Open with the problem statement.** Not a context-setting introduction. The first paragraph is "Currently, X. We need Y. This document proposes Z."
- **"Decision" is fine, "Conclusion" is not.** The decision IS the conclusion. A separate Conclusion section is sheen.
- **Pros / Cons / Alternatives Considered.** These are technical structures, not AI tells. Use them.
- **Status header.** "Status: Proposed / Accepted / Superseded by RFC-N" is conventional. Keep it.
- **No "Executive Summary"** in a doc read by engineers. If you need a TL;DR, write three bullet points and call it "Summary" (max 50 words).

## Code comments and docstrings as prose

When code comments or docstrings get long enough to need humanization (multi-paragraph module headers, README-length docstrings on public APIs), the same doctrine applies, but with two extra rules:

- **Docstring openers should be a single sentence in the imperative or third-person present.** `Return the parsed event count.` Not `This function will return the parsed event count for you.`
- **Do not restate the function signature in prose.** A docstring for `def parse_event(payload: dict) -> int` that begins "This function takes a dictionary called `payload` and returns an integer" is sheen. The reader can see the signature. The docstring's job is the *behavior*, the *failure modes*, and the *invariants*.

Common AI tells in docstrings:

<!-- human-writer:ignore-start (quoted AI tells, cited not used) -->
- "This function is designed to…" → cut "is designed to", start with the verb
- "It takes the following parameters:" → use the docstring format (`Args:` / `:param:`) and stop announcing
- "Returns: An integer representing the count of…" → "Returns: number of parsed events. -1 on schema mismatch."
<!-- human-writer:ignore-end -->

Inline comments rarely trigger AI detection (too short), but the same instinct applies: `# Increment counter` next to `counter += 1` is noise. `# Counter wraps at 2^32, see issue #418` is signal.

## Changelog entries

Changelogs are a technical doc subgenre with very specific failure modes. AI-flavored changelog entries cluster around:

<!-- human-writer:ignore-start (quoted AI tells, cited not used) -->
- "We're excited to announce…" — never in an internal changelog
- "This release brings…" — drop "brings", just list what changed
- "Various improvements and bug fixes" — meaningless filler
- Section headers in marketing language ("Highlights", "What's New") for an internal-only release
<!-- human-writer:ignore-end -->

Good changelog voice is past-tense, terse, one line per change, grouped by Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed (Keep a Changelog format). No prose intro to a release section. The version number and date are the intro.

## Pre-publish checklist (technical)

Before publishing internal technical content, confirm:

```markdown
- [ ] Ran `analyze.py --type technical` — score ≤ 25
- [ ] No "In this document, we will…" opener
- [ ] No "Conclusion" section (or it's >500 words and earns it)
- [ ] Every "robust / scalable / leverage / comprehensive" passes the "replace with 'good'" test
- [ ] Code blocks are not surrounded by paragraphs that re-explain them
- [ ] No "Happy coding!" / "Let's dive in!" filler
- [ ] One sentence per concept; no restating
- [ ] If it's a PROJECT_HISTORY entry: past tense, dated, no marketing words
- [ ] If it's a design doc: opens with problem statement, not context
```

## Calibration with `analyze.py`

Technical weights from `rules.yaml`:

```yaml
technical:     {statistical: 0.5, stylistic: 0.7, structural: 0.3}
```

All three axes are weighted DOWN relative to marketing. The reasoning:

- **Statistical (0.5).** Technical writing has naturally lower sentence-length stdev. A series of API descriptions all run 8-12 words. That is correct, not robotic.
- **Stylistic (0.7).** Still the dominant axis, because AI sheen lives here. But many tier-1 vocab words have legitimate technical use, so the per-hit penalty is reduced.
- **Structural (0.3).** Parallel structure in code-doc lists is expected. Lexical repetition of technical terms (the function name appears 20 times in its own documentation) is fine.

Practically: a technical doc with a stylistic score of 25 is concerning; a structural score of 25 usually is not.

## Worked example

A 200-word technical opener, rewritten.

### Before (AI-flavored, score ~52)

<!-- human-writer:ignore-start (deliberately AI-flavored sample for teaching; must not self-flag) -->
> ## Overview
>
> In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the robust capabilities of our migration system, designed to seamlessly transition your billing infrastructure from a Pay-Per-Usage model to a more scalable Pay-Per-Event approach. By the end of this document, you will have a thorough understanding of the architectural decisions, the migration steps, and the various edge cases we encountered during the implementation. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate this system or a stakeholder seeking to understand its benefits, this README will guide you through every aspect of the process. Let's dive in!
<!-- human-writer:ignore-end -->

Issues, in order of appearance:

<!-- human-writer:ignore-start (quoted fragments from the bad example above) -->
- `comprehensive guide` — tier-1 sheen
- `we will explore` — AI construction (announce-then-deliver)
- `robust capabilities` — `robust` fails the "replace with 'good'" test
- `seamlessly transition` — `seamlessly` is almost never legitimate
- `more scalable` — sheen, no measurement
- `By the end of this document` — announce-then-deliver
- `thorough understanding` — sheen
- `Whether you're` — tier-1 AI construction
- `this README will guide you through every aspect` — AI meta-narration
- `Let's dive in!` — sign-off filler
<!-- human-writer:ignore-end -->

Six tier-1 tells and three AI constructions in one paragraph. The doc has not started yet.

### After (clean, score ~12)

> This README documents the migration from PPU to PPE billing in the Wine BI scraper. The PPU implementation overcharged free-tier users by ~8% because KV-store reads counted as billable events; PPE charges only on `dataset.pushData()` calls.
>
> Migration ran on 2026-03-14. Two edge cases surfaced (see §3): batch pushes counted as one event, and retries on failed pushes were double-charged in the initial deploy.

The second version is shorter, contains specific dates and numbers, names the actual problem, and trusts the reader to know what PPU and PPE mean. The reader is an engineer on this codebase; treat them accordingly.

## Edge case: when the doc IS for non-engineers

Sometimes an internal doc has a mixed audience, like a runbook read by both on-call engineers and a non-technical product manager. The temptation is to add an "Overview for non-technical readers" section in marketing prose. Resist this.

Better: write the doc for engineers, then add a separate one-paragraph "Context" block (≤ 60 words, no sheen vocab) at the top. The runbook stays a runbook. The PM gets a paragraph they can read without scrolling through alert thresholds.

If the audience is genuinely majority non-technical (board memo, exec briefing), this is not a technical doc. Switch to the `marketing` or `short-comms` adapter.
